# So far...
My Podcast called Modulations is part of the [Substack newsletter](https://modulations.substack.com) of the same name and so far we've covered Tidal Cycles, semi-modular and last night's episode started to explore modular, since I am starting to build up a modular rig over the coming years.

# What to expect in the future
## Multi voice Coral and exploring it's signal path
THe OXI Coral is a versatile module with a very clever interface but it takes a bit of learning to figure out how to use it. So in this podcast, have a listen to a middle aged man figure stuff out, especially the signal chain for the module. 

My main aim really is to better understand how to divide the MIDI channels up into parts and how to begin making actual songs with the synth, those that feature maybe a bass, chord progression, drum patterns and maybe a lead if I am successful with the first parts.

The adventure into modular gets more interesting once we had more devices to the system, so what can we do with the Oxi one and Coral, to be honest this will be the typical setup all of the time as you can't do much with the Coral alone. Add further modules in the chain and we're beginning to get very experimental. Imagine the Coral and Strega together or anything else for that matter.

# The Oxi kit, the iPad and AUM - exploring hybrid setups
My common setup at the moment looks like the photo below, although I've flattened it all out for the sake of the picture, in reality it sits on my desk in a different way, so that I can see it all clearly!

The iPad running AUM is my nerve centre, this is connected via a single USB lead to the back of my Minifuse 4, which in turn is connected to my modular system, microphone, headphones and monitoring speakers. The Oxi One is directly connected to the modular via a TRS MIDI cable and patch leads for modulation. 

The iPad has three channels one for the microphone, one for the modular system routed via channels 3 & 4 from the audio interface, Minifuse 4. The third is a mix bus into which the other two feed.

The beauty of this is that I can add effects either on the source channels or the one for the master channel, Mix Bus A. We could make this more complicated but I'm not doing so yet.
