# Where it began
It started as an idea on Hive, the blockchain blogging platform, I still write about it there today via [](https://peakd.com/@nicklewis) but this blog is going to become my origin writing place once again, with content being shared from here to Substack, Hive and all of the socials that I am still friends with at this stage. I have long been into creating music and sound design, since way back when. I've already got an archive of stuff but have recently invested in Modular, I've started building a small rack - exciting!

# Where you'll find it
It will be split into two copies, one for free examples and the other for premium members, payments being taken via Substack and Paypal for example.
