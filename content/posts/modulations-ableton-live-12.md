I have to admit that I've not used Ableton much in recent years as I've been playing around a lot with other devices. I think one of the reasons for this has been that those other options offer more generative options. I am not a classically trained musician, I can play keys and took guitar lessons in my early twenties but computers have always been the way for me.

I learnt to code from an early age and on my Commodore computers 64/Amiga, sound was always my destination for exploring synthesizers etc.

The new features in Ableton centred around composition tools, are a big thing for me and I've decided to pre-order Live 12 and to bring it back into my workflow.

Maybe my DAWless journey was in vain? Maybe hybrid is the best for me.
