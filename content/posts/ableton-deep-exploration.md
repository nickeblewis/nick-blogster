I've owned Ableton for many years but a times I don't feel like I know it well enough, have I tried out every feature it offers to date? Maybe not, so I would really love to document some ideas, experiments and basically build my own documentation for it, some chear sheets, so that I can perform with it confidently.

So let's build up a little journal both here and on modulations.substack.com

## Instruments
## Audio Effects (FX)
## MIDI FX
## Max Devices
## VST
