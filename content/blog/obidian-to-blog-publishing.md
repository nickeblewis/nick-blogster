## Connecting my brain to my blog!
I have been using Obsidian for quite some time now as a "second brain", now who was it who coined that term? I believe it was [Tiago Forte](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)

I use it as a means of capturing ideas, thoughts, to join things together, to plan and to maintain something that I call my daily notes, a near-constant stream of conhere sciousness that I use to figure out what I am doi

￼￼Talkyard￼￼ looks interesting too
Cloned Rach's site which runs locally for cheeky idea borrowingng now and how. I got tired of trying to blog, to complete a piece of writing and felt it much easier to share my notes instead, because my processes are always on the shift. I'll be happy to share these via [Mastodon](octodon.social@nicklewis) for further discourse! I'd love to know your thoughts on this and personal experiences.

Some would call it a "Digital Garden" as it's mostly about growing your ideas and hopefully not dying off!!
## Using Node.js to publish
I've been contemplating ways of copying Obsidian notes across to my [Astro](https://astro.build) powered website and found [Rachels post](https://rachsmith.com/automating-obsidian-to-astro/) - which I've adapted for my own needs, got it working! Yay!
