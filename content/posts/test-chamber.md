If you have been following me for awhile or best of all subscribed to this newsletter, you will know that I am a member of ModCaf and have attended many of their meet-ups in Aldershot since last year.

If not, let me briefly describe who they are, what they do.

MODCAF has been created to support an existing, growing community of musicians.

The Modular Café Aldershot provides the opportunity for like minded synthesizer enthusiasts to meet socially, to exchange ideas, practices, to collaborate, encourage and support one another on a regular basis.

I will share a link at the bottom of this article, so that you can learn more about them, watch the videos there and find links to Soundcloud etc.

I remember hearing about the Test Chamber project in early 2020, when I attended an event at the West End centre for something unrelated. Amongst the people who were present that evening, were these two guys, Ian and Ben, who were there to promote ModCaf which they’d launched in 2018 out of the same venue.

I recall chatting to them and they briefly mentioned recording something in Farnborough’s old wind tunnels, the Test Chamber.

Then covid happened, my family and I move away from Farnborough and I forgot about it all.

One day I was browsing Instagram and there they were, the ModCaf guys in my feed with photos and videos of this incredible event that had just taken place I had missed it completely but then again have I? Did I miss out?

Not exactly.

Last year I decided to pop along to one of their meet-ups, a total stranger, I knew nobody there at all and I was naturally a bit nervous, what if these people were scary and weird?

It turned out I needn’t have worried and they were no weirder than I. It was on this first night, they presented one of the mastered recordings from the Test Chamber project and that a record was being pressed.

Event: Listening Party, 3rd October

Since that first visit, I’ve got to know the people there a bit better and along the way mentioned this newsletter. There are a lot of ModCaffers on here now, which is great and hence Ben invited me to review the album prior to the listening party.

Did I say listening party?

Oh yes indeedy! If you are UK based and within reach of Aldershot in Hampshire, then come along on the 3rd October where around 10 or so of the tracks from the record will be played on the excellent sound system that’s installed at The West End Centre. It’s a public event and you will get to meet the ModCaf regulars and of course myself.

The event is not being streamed online, it’s an in-person shindig.

Setting the scene, the video

So before we go any further, set yourself some time, maybe save this article in Substack because this is the biggest thing I’ve written in years; please watch the following video, to learn more about ModCaf and the build-up to the Test Chamber event last summer.

Then the rest will make more sense with this background information.

Tracks

Adrian Utley - Q121 Drone for dark days

Adrian may be a name you’ve come across before? If not, how about the band Portishead? Ring any bells? Adrian has been one of the band members over the years alongside Beth and Geoff, they formed in the early 90’s, which was an incredible time, I can remember it well, as I was very much into the Bristol scene at the time, the trip-hop phenomenon that emerged from the city has long placed it firmly on the music industry map. Bristol has often been regarded as the “Media City”.



His track that opens the “Test Chamber” record, is haunting, stirring and atmospheric. Adrian’s synth, meanders through the cavity of the chamber, garnished with the delicate minor key of the cellist who accompanied him for the recording. Chatting to Ben online, as far as he can remember, there were three people, two besides Adrian, the Cellist and an effects person.

If you watched the video above, you will have noted that during the preparation process for the recordings, great care and attention was paid to the acoustics of the venue allowing each artist the use of some specialist microphones and speakers through which they could explore these properties. It is interesting how in each of the recordings I noted, how each artist tried different things. 



Adrian spent a lot of time with the ModCaf crew in the setup for the event.

I asked Ben Champion, who is one of the founding members, whether they knew Adrian beforehand and as it turns out they didn’t. They decided it would be really good to get a celebrity artist involved, Adrian’s name came up, they made contact with him and he was very much up for it! 

What a fantastic opportunity for the artists of ModCaf and helps add legitimacy to the project.

Question for Ben - was their a live cellist here alongside Adrian? Plus any photos you might have. Ignore this one now, I think I’ve covered it fine.

Akira Sileas - Study 13 Enigma



Akira’s track, I really enjoyed, it stood out and from the outset made me for some reason think of Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland, poetry and the otherworld. Their performance being broken down into magical chapters, each exploring a series of intriguing ideas, with an aura of mystery.

I would love to know what they used on the occasion, I am thinking Buchla, the modular synthesizer system that they demonstrated and did a walkt-hrough of at a separate ModCaf event I attended. Something I love ModCaf for as all members share their passion and enthusiasm for their machines on a regular basis.

There are some lovely bell, chime and glassy sounds in this recording that rise and fall, during this delightful adventure.

Alex Mousley - Echoes of my father

I would love to know the background story behind this track, which starts in the IDM vein, with housey chords, some lovely glitch sounds and a sampled recording of someone, I am guessing, Alex’s Dad? The track then steps up into a rising arpeggio and maintains

I’ll come back to this one Ben, feels like I’ve shortchanged Alex here, it’s a great track.

Ambit - Chambers

Oooh! A bit of Old Skool/House/Dance floor here and the recording is a great quality too, so credit goes to both Ambit and the sound engineers on the night. A strong four-to-the-floor beat with step sequenced and live synth tweaking at play and a live vocal lead on the top. It’s surely a floor filler this one. Love the hi-hats, one of my favourites instruments! Oh and the 303 bassline of course, great number this one.

So far the variety is very impressive on this album, I am writing these notes as I listen to each track, something of a 3 hour listening marathon but one that is highly enjoyable. I can see this record being a success with everyone. It will released shortly on vinyl, cassette and digital via the official shop, powered by Bandcamp.

Chambers makes great use of the ambience/reverb the venue offered and it must have been absolutely incredible to have been there. Each act was also accompanied by visuals, which would have turned the venue’s darkness into an incredible indoor lightshow.

Blackdown - chiaroscuro

The term “Chiaroscuro” means the treatment of light and shade in painting, especially strong contrasts of light and originated from the Rennaisance movement in the 1500’s. It can also be applied to other arts from photography to music.

Blackdown’s track starts with a rising and falling wind synth sound that morphs into a textured ambience and field recordings of birdsong, easing into a regular breathing rythym, calmly leading into a gorgeous piano performance that demonstrates a strong connection with film scores. I could imagine this piece being the final titles of an emotional motion picture. It’s beauty is tantalising to the listener.

I can see, or at least guess why Blackdown chose the title for the piece, as the contrasts, dance through the music, leading to a percussive reprise towards the end. 

The album spans a multitude of genres and this is a great neo-classical piece.

I’d love to know if the artists when reading this in the future agree with my definitions of their tracks?! Maybe I should invite each one to a podcast episode after the album is released?

Crowd of Ghosts - Tunnel Vision

Introductions in music are always interesting, when you first listen and are then taken by surprise when the main part kicks in. Tunnel vision starts with some lovely ambiences, the build-up on what sounds like a live drumkit and then a resonant kick knocks on the door, intensifies, as if travelling down the tunnel towards you the listener. Then all of a sudden, boom, we are in progressive rock territory, with a delightful medley of instrumentation, that really reminds me of Mike Oldfield, especially the guitar parts. It is pure joy in my headphones.

The entire album was recorded using binaural equipment, so headphones are highly recommended.

Cyber N Powers - You fight, you lose

Techno makes an entrance on this track with a steady flow of complex, infectious rhythms, that weave in and out of each other and a strong melody that rides along with the beat. The vocal samples that are fun and witty. It’s a frenetic track and one that I will go back to again and again.

That is the thing with albums, you form favourites and the tracks you go back to versus those that don’t make a lasting impression. So far I’ve not come aross any of the latter

David James - Broken Swarm

Slowly building from quiet ambiance, this horn flavoured track gradually evolves in volume with rich chords and layered strings blooming into the void. It stirs images in my mind of the daylight or perhaps a swarm of bees emerging from their hive and flying into big blue yonder. It has a feeling of gradual evolution, with it’s lush layers. Is this an orchestra? It sounds a lot like one but of course, it isn’t, it’s a symphony of well crafted synth lines to create a beautiful whole. I really like this one.

Etive - Sweeps

Plucky strings open “Sweeps”, exploring the ambience of the venue, which you can actually download as a convolution reverb for your DAW, as you will have seen in the video. Let me know if ypu’d like a follow up with details on how to use that.

The orchestral sounds, continue to evolve with a lovely underlining cello-esque bass. I am guessing the intrumentation a little bit of course, as I don’t really know, it is just how it sounds and divine it is too. There are some beautiful woodwind sounds in this for sure, such as Oboe and Clarinet, as well as the leading Pizzacato syth that leads us along.

Oooh, then it intensifies. I did say that I chose to write this article in realtime whilst listening to the record, I thought it would be a novel way of doing it. There is so much to take in. What a project this is!

Let’s press on - I shall share the full details at the end for those who would like to attend the launch party or just purchase the album. Either way your support will be much appreciated, I am sure of that!

Graham Johnson - High Flight



Ian-O - Fathers Day

A powerful track that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Gave me goosebumps pretty much, as its story remembers those who bravely defended our country in World War II - especially the pilots who flew Lancaster bombers. The track revolves around one man’s account of his experiences during the war, those who were captured, shot down in battle. Ian’s orchestration builds as the story unfolds. Then halfway through the song, vocalist
