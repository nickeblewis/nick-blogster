Today my new iPhone 15 Pro Max arrived and one of the first things I've tried out around the house at least was the new camera, with 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 times zoom levels. I can't wait to take it out and about tomorrow, as I am going to take a little jaunt into the woods for some photography.

In the meantime, here are some test shots and as you can imagine a zillion more will follow in due course!

Macro is good, really, really, very, very good.
