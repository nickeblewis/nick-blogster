### Journal notes
Add my notes here.....
## Here begins a new thing
I have been using Obsidian for quite some time now as a "second brain", now who was it who coined that term? 
- [ ] Come back to the above question...
I use it as a means of capturing ideas, thoughts, to join things together to plan and to maintain something that I call my daily notes, a near-constant stream of conciousness that I use to figure out what I am doing now and how. I got tired of trying to blog, to complete a piece of writing and felt it much easier to share my notes instead, because my processes are always on the shift. I'll be happy to share these via octodon.social@nicklewis for further discourse!

I am keener to call it a "Digital Garden" as I love that term, everything is mostly growing here and hopefully not dying off!!
## nicklewis.blog
I've been contemplating ways of copying Obsidian notes across to my Astro build website and found Rachels post here [Rachels post here](https://rachsmith.com/automating-obsidian-to-astro/) - which I've adapted for my own needs, got it working! Yay!

Talkyard looks interesting too
Cloned Rach's site which runs locally for cheeky idea borrowing

## thoughts off my brain 
I think this is revolutionary because I spend a lot of time using Obsidian to map out my ideas to solve problems to track and stuff. Iâ€™ve done this to automatically sync between my proposal through for Nick Lewis to Vlog is absolutely amazing.
